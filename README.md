# paradox-syntax README

This repository contains textmate grammars for Paradox Interactive games. Currently:

* A generic paradox grammar
* Outdated extensions for Stellaris, EU4, HOI4 and CK2 which add some extra keywords

It also contains some themes designed to work with these grammars.

These grammars only really work if you use the themes included: Paradox-Dimmed and Paradox-QuietLight. The reason they don't really work is that the paradox scripting language doesn't line up with the expected textmate keywords.
